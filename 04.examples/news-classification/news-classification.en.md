### Example
# Fine-Tune LLM model for News Classification with Knitfab

This guide walks you through fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for classification using Knitfab. Discover how Knitfab automates the fine-tuning process and how you can leverage the LLM-as-a-judge approach for efficient, human-like evaluation.

### Overview
Fine-tuning LLMs involves optimizing multiple parameters to achieve optimal performance for a specific taskâ€”a process that can quickly become overwhelming. Knitfab provides robust management of training artifacts, facilitating seamless experimentation with different configurations. Additionally, we'll explore LLM-as-a-judge, an innovative evaluation method that delivers human-like assessment quality while reducing costs and time.

The following diagram outlines the key components and steps involved:

**Components:**
- __Base Model:__ The pre-trained LLM used as a foundation for fine-tuning. In this example, we'll use GPT-2.
- __Training Dataset:__ The dataset used to fine-tune the model for news classification. We will leverage the 20 Newsgroups dataset from scikit-learn.
- __Fine-tuned Model:__ The resulting model after fine-tuning, now specialized for news classification.
- __Evaluation Dataset:__ A held-out subset of the 20 Newsgroups dataset used for LLM-as-a-judge validation.
- __Metrics:__ Custom metrics designed to evaluate LLM outputs.

**Process:**
- __Train:__ Fine-tune the base LLM on the training dataset to classify news articles.
- __Evaluate:__ Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model using the defined custom metrics and the evaluation dataset.

## Step 0: Define the training and evaluation tasks

### 0-1: Define Training Task

This section provides an in-depth explanation of the logic implemented in `train.py` for fine-tuning a news classification model. The script follows a structured pipeline that includes argument parsing, model preparation, dataset processing, training, and evaluation. Each component is designed to facilitate easy customization and optimization.

### 1. Parse Arguments

The `parse_arguments` function is responsible for handling command-line arguments to configure the training process. Users can specify different parameters to override the default settings, allowing flexibility in model fine-tuning.

#### Key Functionalities
- `--config-file`: Path to a configuration JSON file. If provided, settings in this file will override the command-line arguments.
- `--save-to`: Directory where the trained model and logs will be stored. Defaults to `./out`.
- `--base-model`: Specifies the name of the base model to use for fine-tuning. Defaults to `openai-community/gpt2`.
- `--device`: Defines the hardware on which the training will run (`cuda` or `cpu`). Defaults to `auto`.
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs. Defaults to `1`.
- `--learning-rate`: Specifies the learning rate for model training. Defaults to `2e-5`.

If a configuration file is provided via `--config-file`, its settings will override the corresponding command-line arguments to ensure consistency across different training runs.

#### Code Breakdown
```python
args = parser.parse_args()
if args.config_file:
    with open(args.config_file, "r") as f:
        config = json.load(f)
    for key, value in config.items():
        setattr(args, key.replace("-", "_"), value)
```
- Reads configuration from a JSON file if provided.
- Updates argument values dynamically.

### 2. Initialize Model and Tokenizer

The `setup_environment` method loads the selected base model and tokenizer, ensuring compatibility with quantization settings to optimize performance.

#### Key Functionalities
- Loads `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` with `BitsAndBytesConfig` for 4-bit quantization.
- Configures the tokenizer and sets padding token.

#### Code Breakdown
```python
quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
)
self.model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    self.args.base_model,
    num_labels=self.num_labels,
    quantization_config=quant_config,
    device_map=args.device,
)
```
- Reduces model size using quantization for efficiency.
- Ensures the model is loaded onto the specified device (`cuda/cpu`).

### 3. Load and Preprocess Datasets

The `prepare_datasets` method converts raw datasets into tokenized datasets, suitable for training.

#### Key Functionalities
- Loads data from the `fetch_20newsgroups` dataset.
- Cleans text by removing empty or NaN entries.
- Tokenizes text for input to the model.

#### Code Breakdown
```python
def load_train_datasets(self) -> None:
    raw_train_dataset = fetch_20newsgroups(subset="train")
    self.train_dataset = self.prepare_datasets(raw_train_dataset)

def load_eval_datasets(self) -> None:
    raw_eval_dataset = fetch_20newsgroups(subset="test")
    self.eval_dataset = self.prepare_datasets(raw_eval_dataset)
```
- Loads tran and test data subset from the `fetch_20newsgroups` dataset.
```python
def prepare_datasets(self, dataset: Any) -> Dataset:
    def tokenize(examples):
        return self.tokenizer(examples["text"], truncation=True)

    df = pd.DataFrame({
        "text": dataset.data,
        "label": dataset.target,
    })
    df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=["text"])
    df_cleaned = df_cleaned[df_cleaned["text"].str.strip() != ""]
    
    dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df_cleaned)
    return dataset.map(tokenize, batched=True)
```
- Converts raw text into structured DataFrame format.
- Applies tokenization to ensure compatibility with Transformer models.

### 4. Configure Training Parameters

The `setup_trainer` method initializes the `SFTTrainer` with appropriate hyperparameters and model configurations.

#### Key Functionalities
- Uses `TrainingArguments` to define training settings.
- Configures `LoraConfig` for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
- Uses `DataCollatorWithPadding` to handle different sequence lengths.

)
```
- Defines core training parameters, including batch size, learning rate, weight decay, and gradient accumulation.
- Implements mixed precision (`fp16`) for optimized training efficiency.
- Uses a cosine learning rate scheduler with a warm-up ratio of `0.1`.

```python
peft_config = LoraConfig(
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    r=64,
    bias="none",
    task_type="SEQ_CLS",
)
```
- Implements `LoRA` (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient parameter tuning.
- Sets dropout and rank values to balance regularization and model performance.

```python
collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=self.tokenizer, padding="max_length")
```
- Ensures proper padding for sequences to maintain batch consistency.

```python
self.trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=self.model,
    args=training_args,
    peft_config=peft_config,
    train_dataset=self.train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=self.eval_dataset,
    tokenizer=self.tokenizer,
    data_collator=collator,
)
```
- Initializes the `SFTTrainer` with the configured model, training arguments, dataset, and tokenizer.
- Combines all elements to execute the fine-tuning process efficiently.

### 5. Train and Evaluate the Model

The `run` method orchestrates the entire training process, from setting up the environment to saving the results.

#### Key Functionalities
- Loads datasets and initializes the trainer.
- Executes training and evaluation.
- Saves the trained model and evaluation metrics.

#### Code Breakdown
```python
self.trainer.train()
self.eval_results = self.trainer.evaluate()
self.save_results()
```
- Trains the model on the dataset.
- Evaluates performance on test data.
- Saves model checkpoints and metrics for later use.

### 0-2: LLM-as-a-judge Evaluation

### 1. Parse Arguments

The `parse_arguments` function handles command-line arguments for configuring the evaluation process. Users can specify parameters to override default settings, ensuring flexibility in model evaluation.

#### Key Functionalities
- `--config-file`: Path to a configuration JSON file. If provided, settings in this file override command-line arguments.
- `--model-path`: Path to the fine-tuned model. Defaults to `./in/model`.
- `--save-to`: Directory where evaluation results and logs will be stored. Defaults to `./out`.
- `--device`: Specifies the hardware for inference (`cuda` or `cpu`). Defaults to `auto`.
- `--num-samples`: Number of test samples to evaluate. Defaults to `100`.
- `--threshold`: Deepeval test threshold for performance measurement. Defaults to `0.8`.

If a configuration file is provided via `--config-file`, its settings will override corresponding command-line arguments for consistency.

### 2. Create Classifier

The `create_classifier` function initializes a text classification model for evaluation.

#### Key Functionalities
- Loads a fine-tuned model using `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`.
- Retrieves a tokenizer using `AutoProcessor`.
- Uses `transformers.pipeline` for efficient text classification.

#### Code Breakdown
```python
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path, num_labels=num_labels)
tokenizer = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path)

return pipeline(
    "text-classification",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    device=device,
    max_length=970
)
```
- Initializes a classification pipeline with the given model and tokenizer.
- Ensures maximum sequence length does not exceed `970` tokens.

### 3. Generate Test Cases

The `get_test_cases` function retrieves test samples from the `20 Newsgroups` dataset and prepares them for evaluation.

#### Key Functionalities
- Fetches the `20 Newsgroups` dataset.
- Maps numerical labels to category names.
- Generates test cases with expected and actual classification outputs.

#### Code Breakdown
```python
raw_eval_dataset = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test')
categories = raw_eval_dataset.target_names

data = raw_eval_dataset.data[:num_samples]
target = raw_eval_dataset.target[:num_samples]

classifier = create_classifier(model_path, num_labels, device)
```
- Retrieves `num_samples` from the dataset.
- Uses the trained classifier to predict categories for each test sample.

```python
for text, category_idx in zip(data, target):
    expected_category = categories[category_idx]
    prompt = f"### [HUMAN] Classify this news article: '{text}'\n"
    
    actual_output = classifier(prompt)[0]["label"]
    actual_output = map_category(actual_output, categories)
    
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=text,
        actual_output=actual_output,
        expected_output=expected_category,
    )
    test_cases.append(test_case)
```
- Formats input samples for classification.
- Compares predicted category (`actual_output`) with ground truth (`expected_category`).
- Stores results as test cases for evaluation.

### 4. Evaluate Model Performance

The `TestGPT2Model` class manages the evaluation process using the `deepeval` framework.

#### Key Functionalities
- Defines `CategoryPrecision` metric for classification performance.
- Runs evaluations using `deepeval.evaluate`.
- Saves evaluation results to disk.

#### Code Breakdown
```python
return GEval(
    name="CategoryPrecision",
    threshold=self.args.threshold,
    criteria="Category classifier precision - determine if the actual output matched the provided expected output",
    evaluation_steps=[
        "Award 1.0 points for exact match between actual and expected category",
        "Award 0.5 points for semantically related categories",
        "Award 0.0 points if categories are unrelated",
        "Minimum score after penalties is 0.0",
    ],
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],
)
```
- Defines a scoring metric for classification accuracy.
- Penalizes incorrect or ambiguous predictions.

```python
def run_test(self):
    self.setup_class()
    self.eval_result = self.test_category_prediction()
    self.save_evaluate_result()
```
- Runs evaluation tests on the trained model.
- Stores results in a JSON file for analysis.

## Step 1: Build and push docker image to Knitfab
This step involves creating Docker images for the training and evaluation of the LLM. These images will be pushed to the Knitfab registry for use within the Knitfab platform.

### 1-1. To Build Docker Images:

### 1. Build `news-classification-train` Image:
```bash
docker build -t news-classification-train:v1.0 \
             -f scripts/train/Dockerfile \
             ./scripts/train
```
The `news-classification-train` image is responsible for fine-tuning of the model.

### 2. Build `news-classification-evaluate` Image:
```bash
docker build -t news-classification-evaluate:v1.0 \
             -f scripts/evaluate/Dockerfile \
             ./scripts/evaluate
```
The `news-classification-evaluate` image is used to evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model with LLM-as-a-judge.

### 1-2. (Optional) To Verify Docker Images:
> [!Note]
> 
> If you're confident in your images, feel free to skip ahead to pushing them to Knitfab. ([To Push Docker Images to Knitfab](#to-push-docker-images-to-knitfab))

### 1. Run the Fine-tune Image:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all \
    -v "$(pwd)/configs:/configs" \
    -v "$(pwd)/out:/out" \
    news-classification-train:v1.0
```
This command runs the `news-classification-train:v1.0` image in an interactive mode.
- The `-v` flags mount the host directories containing the config files (`/configs`) and the output directory (`/out`) into the container.
- This allows you to test the image locally and generate the fine-tuned model.

### 2. Configuring a Local LLM using Ollama:
This example uses a local LLM for LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. You can optionally configure an OpenAI API key as described in the documentation: `https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/metrics-introduction#using-openai`. Alternatively, if you prefer to use your own custom model, follow the setup instructions here: `https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/metrics-introduction#using-any-custom-llm`.

#### Create a Docker Network:
```bash
docker network create ollama-net
```
This command creates a Docker network named `ollama-net`, which will allow the Ollama container to communicate with other containers on the same network.

#### Run the Ollama Docker Container:
```bash
docker run -d --gpus all --network ollama-net \ 
           -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 \
           --name ollama ollama/ollama
```
This command runs the Ollama Docker image in detached mode (`-d`).

- `--gpus all`: This option makes all available GPUs accessible to the container. If you want to specify particular GPUs, consult the Docker documentation.
- `--network ollama-net`: This connects the container to the `ollama-net` network.
- `-v ollama:/root/.ollama`: This mounts a Docker volume named `ollama` to the `/root/.ollama` directory inside the container. This ensures that your Ollama models and data are persisted even if the container is stopped or removed.
- `-p 11434:11434`: This maps port `11434` on the host machine to port `11434` in the container, which is the default port Ollama uses.
- `--name ollama`: This assigns the name ollama to the container, making it easier to manage.
- `ollama/ollama`: This specifies the Docker image to use.

#### Pull the Llama 3.2 Model:
```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.2
```
This command executes the `ollama pull llama3.2` command inside the running ollama container to download the Llama 3.2 model.  The `-it` flags provide an interactive terminal session within the container.

### 2. Model Evaluation with LLM-as-a-judge:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all --network ollama-net\
    -v "$(pwd)/configs:/configs" \
    -v "$(pwd)/out:/out" \
    -v "$(pwd)/out/model:/in/model" \
    news-classification-evaluate:v1.0
```
- The command runs `news-classification-evaluate:v1.0` image and connects the container to the `ollama-net` network.
- The image evaluate the fine-tuned model using the defined custom metric and `test` subset of the `20 Newsgroups` dataset.
- The evaluation metrics will be saved as a JSON file named `metrics.json` in the `out/metrics` directory.

### 3. Performance Analysis:

Review the `metrics.json` file to analyze the model's performance based on the defined custom metrics. This analysis will allow you to evaluate the effectiveness of your fine-tuning. Consider whether the current custom metrics adequately reflect your specific requirements, and redefine them if necessary.

### 1-3. To Push Docker Images to Knitfab:

### 1. Tag Images with Registry URI:

Before pushing the images to the Knitfab registry, you need to tag them with the correct registry URI. This allows Docker to identify the target registry for the push operation.
```bash
docker tag ${docker_image} ${registry_uri}/${docker_image}
```
Replace:

- `${docker_image}` with the name of each built image (e.g., `news-classification-train:v1.0`, `news-classification-evaluate:v1.0`).
- `${registry_uri}` with the actual URI of your Knitfab registry (e.g., `192.0.2.1:30503`).

### 2. Push Images to Knitfab Registry:

Now, push the tagged images to the Knitfab registry:
```bash
docker push ${registry_uri}/${docker_image}
```
Replace `${docker_image}` with the name of each image (including the registry URI) as tagged in the previous step.

## Step 2: Fine-tuning
This step involves the fine-tuning of the LLM for news classification.

### 1. Generate YAML tempelate:

You have two options for generating the YAML template:
- Option 1: Create a Blank Template:
```bash
knit plan template --scratch > ./plans/news-classification-train.v1.0.yaml
```
This creates a new, empty YAML template file named `news-classification-train.v1.0.yaml` in the `./plans` directory. You will need to manually populate this template with the necessary configuration details.
- Option 2: Generate Template from Docker Image:
```bash
docker save ${registry_uri}/news-classification-train:v1.0 | \
    knit plan template > ./plans/news-classification-train.v1.0.yaml
```
This command generates a YAML template based on the Docker image `news-classification-train:v1.0`.

\* Replace `${registry_uri}` with the actual URI of your Knitfab registry.

\* This approach can help automate some of the configuration process.

### 2. Modify YAML Template:
- Crucial Modifications:
  - `image`: 
    If your Knitfab Kubernetes Cluster utilizes a local registry, replace `registry_uri` within the `image` field with `localhost`. 

    Example:
    ```YAML
    # Replace 192.0.2.1
    image: "192.0.2.1:30503/news-classification-train:v1.0"
    # With localhost
    image: "localhost:30503/news-classification-train:v1.0"
    ```
    - This ensures the image is pulled from the local registry.

  - `inputs`, `outputs`, `log`: 
    Add the following tags to the `inputs`, `outputs` and `log` sections:
    
    <br>

    ```YAML
    inputs:
      - path: "/configs"
        tags:
          - "type:config"
          - "project:news-classification"
    
    outputs:
      - path: "/out/model"
        tags:
          - "type:model"
          - "project:news-classification"
    
    log:
      tags:
        - "type:log"
        - "project:news-classification"
    ```
    - This facilitates better organization and filtering of `inputs`, `outputs` and `log` within the Knitfab system.

  - resources:
    Define the required CPU, Memory, and GPU resources

    ```YAML
    resources:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 10Gi
      nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
    ```
    

- Other Important Considerations:
  Always double-check that your modified YAML template adheres to the correct structure and syntax. You can use the YAML file provided in the `/plans` directory of the cloned Git repository as a reference.

### 3. Apply the YAML Template:
```bash
train_plan=$(knit plan apply ./plans/news-classification-train.v1.0.yaml)
```
This command sends the YAML template to the Knitfab API, which creates a new Plan based on the provided configuration. 

The output of the command, which is stored in the `train_plan` variable, is a JSON object containing details about the created Plan.

### 4. Push Configuration File to Knitfab:
```bash
knit data push -t type:config \
               -t project:news-classification \
               -n ./configs
```
This command pushes the configuration files located at `./configs` to the Knitfab platform.

The `-t` flags add tags (e.g., `type:config`, `project:news-classification`) that Knitfab uses to identify and associate configurations with generated Plans.

### 5. Extract the Plan Id:
```bash
train_plan_id=$(echo "$train_plan" | jq -r '.planId')
```
This command extracts the unique Id of the created Plan from the JSON output.

### 6. Confirm the Run Status:

After applying the YAML template, Knitfab will initiate a Run to execute the training plan. You can monitor the status of this Run using the following command:
```bash
knit run find -p $train_plan_id
```
This command displays the training Run associated with the specified Plan Id. Periodically execute the command and wait until the `status` changes to `done` to indicate that the initial training has completed successfully.

### 7. Retrieve Model Information:

Once the training Run has completed successfully, you can retrieve information about the generated model artifact:
- Get Run Information:
```bash
train_run=$(knit run find -p $train_plan_id)
```
- Extract Run Outputs:
```bash
train_outputs=$(echo "$train_run" | jq -r '.[-1].outputs')
```
- Get Model Knit Id:
```bash
train_model_knit_id=$(echo "$train_outputs" | jq -r '.[0].knitId')
```

### 8. (Optional) Review the Run Log:

If you want to examine the logs generated during the training process, you can use the following commands:
- Get Run Id:
```bash
train_run_id=$(echo "$train_run" | jq -r '.[-1].runId')
```
- Show Run Log:
```bash
knit run show --log $train_run_id
```

### 9. (Optional) Download the Model:

If you need to access the trained model artifact directly, you can download it from the Knitfab platform using the following command:
```bash
knit data pull -x $train_model_knit_id ./out
```
This command downloads the trained model artifact from the Knitfab platform and stores it in the `./out` directory.

## Step 3: Set up Ollama for LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation
This step deploys and configures Ollama, the application that will serve as the foundation for our LLM-as-a-judge evaluation process.
> [!Note]
> 
> If you plan to use a different LLM for evaluation, skip this step and configure your chosen LLM to ensure it's accessible during the evaluation Run.

### 1. Define Deployment and Service resources:
Create two YAML files, one for the Deployment and one for the Service, with the following content. Save these files, for example, as `ollama-deployment.yaml` and `ollama-service.yaml` respectively. These files define how your Ollama application will be deployed and accessed within your Kubernetes cluster.

- `ollama-deployment.yaml`

```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ollama
  namespace: knitfab
  labels:
    app: ollama
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ollama
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ollama
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ollama
          image: ollama/ollama
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "4"
              memory: "5Gi"
              nvidia.com/gpu: 1
            limits:
              cpu: "4"
              memory: "5Gi"
              nvidia.com/gpu: 1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 11434
          lifecycle:
            postStart:
              exec:
                command: ["sh", "-c", "ollama pull llama3.2"]
```

- `ollama-service.yaml`
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ollama
  namespace: knitfab
spec:
  selector:
    app: ollama
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 11434
      targetPort: 11434
  type: ClusterIP
```
For simplicity, in this example, we'll deploy the Ollama Deployment and Service into the same namespace as Knitfab.
### 2. Deploy Ollama application:
> [!Note]
> 
> **Important Note Regarding GPU Access:** If you have only one GPU available in your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to enable GPU sharing features like Time-Slicing or Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) to allow multiple Pods, including your Ollama Pod, to access it concurrently.  Without these features, your Ollama Deployment might fail or be unable to utilize the GPU.
>
> For detailed instructions on configuring GPU sharing, please consult the official NVIDIA documentation:
>
> - [GPU Sharing](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/gpu-sharing.html)
> - [Multi-Instance GPU (MIG)](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/gpu-operator-mig.html)
>
> Once you've addressed any GPU sharing requirements (if applicable), you can proceed with deploying the Ollama application.

To deploy the Ollama application, execute the following commands:
```bash
kubectl apply -f ollama/ollama-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f ollama/ollama-service.yaml
```
## Step 4: LLM-as-a-judge evaluation
After fine-tuning, we will evaluate the model performance and check for any issues.

### 1. Generate YAML tempelate:
- Option 1: Create a Blank Template:
```bash
knit plan template --scratch > ./plans/news-classification-evaluate.v1.0.yaml
```
- Option 2: Generate Template from Docker Image:
```bash
docker save ${registry_uri}/news-classification-evaluate:v1.0 | \
    knit plan template > ./plans/news-classification-evaluate.v1.0.yaml
```
\* Replace `${registry_uri}` with the actual URI of your Knitfab registry.

### 2. Modify YAML Template:
- Crucial Modifications:
  - `image`: 
    If your Knitfab Kubernetes Cluster utilizes a local registry, replace `registry_uri` within the image field with `localhost`.

    Example:
    ```YAML
    # Replace 192.0.2.1
    image: "192.0.2.1:30503/news-classification-evaluate:v1.0"
    # With localhost
    image: "localhost:30503/news-classification-evaluate:v1.0"
    ```
  - `inputs`, `outputs`, `log`: 
    Add the following tags to the `inputs`, `outputs` and `log` sections:
    
    <br>
    
    ```YAML
    inputs:
      - path: "/configs"
        tags:
          - "type:config"
          - "project:news-classification"
      
      - path: "/in"
        tags:
          - "type:model"
          - "project:news-classification"

    outputs:
      - path: "/out"
        tags:
          - "type:metrics"
          - "project:news-classification"

    log:
      tags:
        - "type:log"
        - "project:news-classification"
    ```
> [!Note]
> 
> To ensure the evaluation dynamically recognizes the output model from the training process, we will *not* define the `in/model` within the configuration file. Instead, we will explicitly define `in/model` within the Plan YAML template.
  - resources: 
  Define the required CPU, Memory, and GPU resources

    ```YAML
    resources:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 10Gi
      nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
    ```

- Other Important Considerations:
  Double-check that your modified YAML template adheres to the correct structure and syntax. You can use the YAML file provided in the `/plans` directory of the cloned Git repository as a reference.

### 3. Apply the YAML Template:
```bash
evaluate_plan=$(knit plan apply ./plans/news-classification-evaluate.v1.0.yaml)
```
- The `evaluate_plan` variable will contain the JSON response from the Knitfab API, which includes details about the created Plan.

- Since the configuration file was pushed to Knitfab in the previous step, a Run under `evaluate_plan` will be automatically triggered and processed.

### 4. Extract the Plan Id:
```bash
evaluate_plan_id=$(echo "$evaluate_plan" | jq -r '.planId')
```

### 5. Confirm the Run Status:
```bash
knit run find -p $evaluate_plan_id
```
Wait until the `status` changes to `done` to indicate that the validation has completed successfully.

### 6. (Optional) Retrieve Validation Metrics Information:
- Get Run Information:
```bash
evaluate_run=$(knit run find -p $evaluate_plan_id)
```
- Extract Run Outputs:
```bash
evaluate_outputs=$(echo "$evaluate_run" | jq -r '.[-1].outputs')
```
- Get Validation Metrics Knit Id:
```bash
evaluate_metrics_knit_id=$(echo "$evaluate_outputs" | jq -r '.[0].knitId')
```

### 7. (Optional) Review the Run Log:
- Get Run Id:
```bash
evaluate_run_id=$(echo "$evaluate_run" | jq -r '.[-1].runId')
```
- Show Run Log:
```bash
knit run show --log $evaluate_run_id
```

### 8. (Optional) Download the Metrics:
```bash
knit data pull -x $evaluate_metrics_knit_id ./out
```
This command downloads the evaluation metrics artifact from the Knitfab platform and stores it in the `./out` directory.

## Step 5: Clean up
#### 5-1. To Remove a Run:

> [!Caution]
>
> - You can only delete a Run if it is **already stopped** and there are **no other runs dependent on it**.
> - Deleting a Run will also **permanently delete any artifacts** generated by that Run (e.g., models, metrics).

> [!Warning]
>
> Deleting a Run is an **irreversible** action.

```bash
knit run rm ${run_id}
```
Replace `${run_id}` with the unique Id of the Run in the following sequence: `$evaluate_run_id` â†’ `$train_run_id`.

#### 5-2. To Deactivate a Plan:

If you no longer require a registered Plan, use the following command to deactivate it:

```bash
knit plan active no ${plan_id}
```
Replace `${plan_id}` with the unique Id of the Plan you want to deactivate (e.g., `$train_plan_id`, `$evaluate_plan_id`).

#### 5-3. To Remove the Uploaded Dataset:

To remove an uploaded dataset in Knitfab, you must delete the associated upload Run.

**1. Find the Dataset Run Id:**
- List Datasets:
  - Execute the following command to list all datasets with the tag `project:news-classification`:
```bash
knit data find -t project:news-classification
```
  - Example Output:
```json
{
  "knitId": "de3cec00-d723-40e3-b299-536bacdbbe44",
  "tags": [
    ...
    "project:news-classification",
    ...
  ],
  "upstream": {
    "mountpoint": {
      "path": "/upload",
      "tags": []
    },
    "run": {
      "runId": "596103be-a880-4a02-aea8-adfdbef1020b", 
      "status": "done",
      "updatedAt": "2025-01-27T10:14:28.237+00:00",
      "plan": {
        "planId": "cde9c9c3-a604-4057-9102-ed5f85d4afc7",
        "name": "knit#uploaded"
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
- Locate the Upload Run:
  - In the output, identify the dataset entry where the `upstream.mountpoint.path` is equal to `/upload`.
  - Extract the corresponding `upstream.run.runId` value.

**2. Remove the Run:**
> [!Warning]
>
> Deleting a Run is an **irreversible** action. It will permanently delete the Run and any associated artifacts, including the uploaded dataset.
- Execute the following command:
```bash
knit run rm ${run_id}
```
Replace `${run_id}` with the `runId` obtained in step 1.

### Summary
This example showcases how to leverage Knitfab to streamline the process of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and evaluating their performance using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Specifically, it demonstrates:

- **Automated LLM Fine-tuning with Knitfab:** Knitfab simplifies the management of training artifacts, enabling seamless experimentation with diverse configurations and maintaining a clear record of progress. This eliminates the overhead of manual tracking and facilitates efficient iteration.
- **Efficient LLM Evaluation with LLM-as-a-Judge:** By employing an LLM as a judge, this example highlights a cost-effective and time-saving method for assessing LLM quality, achieving human-comparable evaluation while significantly reducing manual effort.

### Troubleshooting
#### Problem 1:
Knitfab Run is stuck in "starting" status and doesn't progress.
```json
{
        "runId": "64b5a7ae-5c85-48f1-b785-955c1709174a",
        "status": "starting",
        "updatedAt": "2025-01-30T01:01:03.589+00:00",
        ...
}
```
**Debugging Steps:**

**1. Inspect the Kubernetes Pods:**
```bash
kubectl -n knitfab get po
```
This command lists all pods in the `knitfab` namespace. Look for the pod associated with your Run Id (`64b5a7ae-5c85-48f1-b785-955c1709174a` in this example).

**2. Analyze Pod Status:**

Pay close attention to the `STATUS` column in the output.  You might see something like this:

| NAME | READY | STATUS | RESTARTS | AGE |
|---|---|---|---|---| 
| worker-run-64b5a7ae-5c85-48f1-b785-955c1709174a-nzhpq | 1/2 | ImagePullBackOff | 0 | 101s |

**`ImagePullBackOff` Error**: This indicates that Kubernetes can't pull the Docker image required for your run. Follow the steps that match the type of your resitry.
  - **Local Registry:** If you're using a local Docker registry, ensure the `image` field in your Plan YAML uses `localhost` for the registry URI:

  <br>

  ```YAML
  image: "localhost:30503/news-classification-train:v1.0"
  ```

  - **Remote Registry:** If you're using a remote registry (like Docker Hub), verify that your Knitfab Kubernetes cluster has the necessary credentials (e.g., username/password, access token) to pull the image.

**3. Reapply the Plan:** 

After fixing the image pull issue, you'll likely need to:
- **Stop the current Run:** 
```bash
knit run stop --fail ${run_id}
```
(Replace `${run_id}` with your actual Run Id, e.g., `64b5a7ae-5c85-48f1-b785-955c1709174a`)
- **(Optional) Remove the Run:** Follow the instructions in "To Remove a Run" under [Step 5: Clean Up](#step-5-clean-up).
- **Deactivate the old Plan:** Follow the instructions in "To Deactivate a Plan" under [Step 5: Clean Up](#step-5-clean-up).
- **Apply a new Plan:** Refer to the relevant section based on the type of training you're doing:
  - [Step 2: Initial training.](#step-2-initial-training)
  - [Step 3: Model validation.](#step-3-model-validation)
  - [Step 4: Incremental training and validation.](#step-4-incremental-training-and-validation)
